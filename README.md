## üéØ The Vision: More Than Just a Tool

In the world of cybersecurity, reconnaissance is the critical first step. Yet, analysts often find themselves juggling multiple terminals, running separate scripts for DNS, WHOIS, and subdomain enumeration. The process is fragmented and inefficient.

**Intel-Scan was born from a simple vision:** to unify these essential OSINT tasks into a single, cohesive, and elegant framework.

This project began as a powerful **Command-Line Interface (CLI)**, optimized for speed and automation. But true power lies in accessibility. It then evolved, incorporating a full-featured **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** to make its robust engine available to everyone ... from seasoned pentesters to security analysts preparing client reports. This dual-interface approach ensures that no matter your workflow, Intel-Scan has you covered.

## üöÄ The Dual-Interface Philosophy

Intel-Scan is built on the belief that a great tool should adapt to the user, not the other way around.

### üåê The Graphical User Interface (GUI)

The GUI is the heart of visual analysis in Intel-Scan. It's designed for clarity, ease of use, and comprehensive reporting, making it perfect for in-depth investigations and preparing client-facing deliverables.

</div>

### ‚å®Ô∏è The Command-Line Interface (CLI)

The CLI is where it all began. It's built for speed, efficiency, and automation. For the power user who lives in the terminal, the CLI provides direct access to the scanning engine with a clean, interactive menu system powered by the `rich` library.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Deep Dive

This project was built with professional software architecture principles to ensure it is maintainable, scalable, and efficient.

### Project Architecture

The application follows the **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)** principle by separating the core logic from the user interfaces. This ensures that any bug fix or improvement to the scanning engine is immediately available to both the CLI and GUI.

```
Intel-Scan/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ intel_scan_core/    # (The Engine) Shared logic for scanning, parsing, and reporting.
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ __init__.py     # Makes this directory a Python package.
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ logic.py        # Contains all backend functions.
‚îÇ
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ data/               # Contains data files, like wordlists for scanning.
‚îÇ
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ intelscan_cli.py    # (Interface 1) The command-line interface.
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ intelscan_gui.py    # (Interface 2) The graphical user interface.
‚îÇ
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ requirements.txt    # A list of all Python dependencies for easy installation.
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md           # You are here!
```

### Technology Stack

- **Backend & Core Logic:** Python 3
- **CLI:** [Rich](https://github.com/Textualize/rich) for beautiful terminal UIs & [Typer](https://github.com/tiangolo/typer) (implicitly, via CLI structure).
- **GUI:** [Gradio](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio) for rapid web UI development.
- **Core Libraries:** `dnspython`, `python-whois`, `pandas`.

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mizazhaider-ceh/Intel-Scan.git
cd Intel-Scan
```

### Step 2: Set Up a Virtual Environment (Highly Recommended)

This isolates the project's dependencies and avoids conflicts.

### Step 3: Install All Dependencies

This command reads the `requirements.txt` file and installs every library needed for both the CLI and GUI.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 4: Add Your Data

- For subdomain scanning to work, place your wordlist file (e.g., `common_subdomains.txt`) inside the `data/wordlists/` directory.
